# SparkRepo

This repository was created for the Big Data course and contains Homework 1 (HW1). The assignment involves implementing a search engine using Apache Spark and MongoDB. The tasks include reading and cleaning documents from the 20 Newsgroups Dataset from Kaggle, building an inverted index, saving the index to MongoDB, and querying the database to retrieve relevant documents based on user input. The project demonstrates practical use of Big Data processing, Spark RDD operations, and MongoDB for storage and retrieval.
